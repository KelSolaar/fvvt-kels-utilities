Some of this venom may be salvaged before it dries.\n\nProficiency with the poisoner kit may be used for harvesting this venom. On a successful check, the character harvests the creature's venom. The venom must be refined before producing 1 dose of Arcanaloth Poison (see below). On a failed check, the character is unable to extract the venom. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature's venom.\n\nRefining the Poison: Once the venom is extracted, an alchemist (or someone proficient in the poisoner's kit) can spend 12 hours and 100gp worth of material to create Arcanaloth Poison (DC 14 Poisoner Kit or Alchemist Supplies check).\n\nArcanaloth Poison (Injury): Arcanaloth Poison is the exact equivalent of Serpent Venom (DMG p258). The poison can coat up to 3 pieces of ammunition or 1 melee weapon for 1 minute. Applying the poison takes 1 action. Any creature successfully hit must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking [[/r 3d6]] poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This poison usually sells for 200gp, but the poison is often considered an illicit good (and may not be sold to normal vendors).",

Each failed attempt deals 22 (4dl0) psychic damage to the slaad.\n\nUses: If a slaad is killed, that slaad's gem can not be used to control other slaadi by itself.

If obtained while the slaad is alive, the slaad will obey whoever possesses the gem.\n\nObtaining the Gem from a Living Slaad: Certain spells can be used to acquire the gem. If the slaad fails its saving throw against imprisonment, the spell can transfer the gem to the spellcaster's open hand, instead of imprisoning the slaad. A wish spell, if cast in the slaad's presence, can be worded to acquire the gem. A greater restoration spell cast on the slaad destroys the gem without harming the slaad.\n\r\nSomeone who is proficient in Wisdom (Medicine) can attempt to remove the gem from an incapacitated slaad . Each try requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work and a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Each failed attempt deals 22 (4dl0) psychic damage to the slaad.\n\nUses: If a slaad is killed, that slaad's gem can not be used to control other slaadi by itself. However, it's magic can be used to enhance certain spells cast on other slaadi. While holding the gem, any slaad that is targeted by Enthrall, Suggestion, or Charm Monster, will have disadvantage on the creature's Wisdom save.",

However, it's magic can be used to enhance certain spells cast on other slaadi.

On a successful check, the character harvests 1 vial of venom that must be refined before producing 1 dose of Thri-kreen Poison (see below). On a failed check, the character is unable to extract any venom. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature's poison.\n\nRefining the Poison: Once the venom is extracted, an alchemist (or someone proficient in the poisoner's kit) can spend 12 hours and 100gp worth of material to create Thri-kreen Poison (DC 12 Poisoner Kit or Alchemist Supplies check).\n\nThri-kreen Poison (Injury): A creature can spend an action to coat 1 melee weapon, or 3 pieces of ammunition with this poison. The poison lasts for 1 minute, or until it successfully affects a target. A creature hit with a weapon coated with this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also paralyzed while poisoned in this way. The poisoned target can repeat the saving throw on each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This poison usually sells for 200gp, but the poison is often considered an illicit good (and may not be sold to normal vendors).",

On a failed check, the character is unable to extract the stinger.

The poison can coat up to 3 pieces of ammunition or 1 melee weapon for 1 minute. Applying the poison takes 1 action. Any creature successfully hit must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking [[/r 3d6]] poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
