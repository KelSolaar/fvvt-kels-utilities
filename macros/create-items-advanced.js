      "<p>Do you depend on your armor to protect you? Ever seen a comrade-in-arms fall due to poorly maintained armor, the steel rusted, and the leather binders stiffened and worn with age? Well, that will never be your problem with our fantastic armor care kit! Coming in a stylish, yet practical, wooden box, the kit contains 3 different brushes (coarse, medium, and fine), 5 pieces of cloth, 2 vials of oil (one for rust treatment, the other for leather care) and polish for both leather and steel. These allow you to keep your armor clean and protected from the elements. For an extra 2 silver pieces, we'll also throw in our special Aurora's Water-Away grease, which will keep your armor from rusting, if applied before submerging. Simply apply and it'll provide up to an hour's worth of protection in even the briniest of saltwater seas.</p><p><strong>Aurora's Note</strong>: Using Aurora's Water-Away grease provides advantage on all saving throws against corrosion, such as that caused by the antennae of rust monsters.</p>",

    description:
      "<p>Eversharp oil is a specially created blade oil that can be used for any edged weapon. It is slightly acidic, and eats through a very, very thin layer of metal with each application, leaving the weapon as sharp as ever. Eversharp oil comes in a glass vial with enough oil for 10 applications. Simply pour over the blade in a thin layer, leave for a minute, and then wipe off with a clean cloth, leaving your weapon ready for use, and eliminating the need for a whetstone (unless the blade is chipped, in which case we recommend first using a whetstone to clear the chip, and then an application of Eversharp oil). Eversharp oil is as flammable as lamp oil and should be kept away from open flames. Please note that if the blade is allowed to air dry, instead of being wiped clean, the dried Eversharp oil remains flammable.</p><p><strong>Aurora's Note</strong>: If air dried on a weapon, and the weapon is then ignited, the Eversharp oil catches fire and emits light as a torch for 2 rounds.</p>",

      '<p>Are you always losing your companions to traps that you already discovered? Ever had to exit a dungeon at a run, only to turn down the wrong corridor? Well, fret no more, as the mapmaking kit is here for you. The kits consist of 10 pages of blank parchment and 10 pages of parchment with a pre drawn grid to make cartography easier for you. Along with this, you get a series of 5 colored markers to mark your way, a measuring compass and a divider, and a steel ruler for drawing straight lines (which comes with a number of stencils for the most common markers on maps, like "danger", a compass rose, "monster here", "trap", and more). This can be customized to fit your needs at a cost of 5 sp, and a wait time for 2-3 days for the work. Furthermore, you get a goose quill or a peacock feather upgrade for 1 gp, with 3 steel nibs, and a miniature bottle of black ink. It also comes with a handy, 20-page guide on how to make maps, along with a sample map for Waterdeep and the Sword Coast, which the beginner can study from and copy in order to learn how to make a functional map. All of this comes in a wax sealed and waterproofed oaken tube for you to roll up the parchment, and an oaken case for the supplies. Extra supplies of parchment, ink, and markers can be bought at any Aurora\'s Emporium for a measly 5 sp.</p><p><strong>Aurora\'s Note</strong>: The mapmaking kit counts as cartographer\'s tools, but also gives advantage on any check made to create an accurate map.</p>',

Once the bun has reached a good size (about the size of a child's fist) you flatten it like a pancake. Once that is done, you put it aside, while you mix the pre-packaged spices with minced meat. Any minced meat will do, except goat--goat gives it a horrible taste, but chicken or poultry generally works best. Into the middle of this pancake you place a dollop of the mince. Then you roll the pancake closed and stick it in an oven until it has reached a golden-brown color. If you lack the oven, simply put it on a steel plate (for adventures, a steel shield serves nicely for this dish), and place it in an open fire--but make sure that the flames cannot reach the bun directly. Once it's done, allow it to cool to a lukewarm temperature, stick it in a basket, and head off to your favorite campsite.</p><p><strong>Aurora's Note</strong>: The package contains enough powder to make 10 rolls. All you need to do is add about 30 oz of water and the minced meat, to your liking.</p>",

We have then picked the finest and prettiest flowers that we can find, and alchemically preserved them (guaranteed to last at least a week!), so that you can bring them to your loved ones. Roses are always popular, as are lilies and tulips, so these are most often available, but every country has its own traditions, and we strive to accommodate these wherever we can.</p>',

The other favorite comes to us from Tethyr, where "Heavy Heart" mixes amber and vanilla into a heady mix that will set your senses ablaze with passion.

They were asked by local beekeepers if there was a druidic alternative to the bulky and expensive beekeeping suits they used (also available from Aurora's Emporium, at a cost of 10 gold pieces per suit). Sting-BeeGone is that solution. It is a cream that you spread across any exposed skin, typically your hands, arms, and face. It consists of a thick, greasy whale fat that has been mixed with crushed cloves. It has then been smoked in a wood stove for several hours, giving it a distinctive smell that bees (and most other insects) find repellant. It will keep you safe for hours when working in an area full of bees, wasps, or other stinging insects. Sting-Bee-Gone comes in a small jar with enough ointment for 10 full-body applications for a normal human.</p><p><strong>Aurora's Note</strong>: Please note that the protection does not necessarily extend to intelligent insectile life.

It consists of a heavy leather mask, in the shape of a crow or other carrion bird's beak, with a special compartment in the beak area for you to place herbs and spices that'll remove any unpleasant smells. More importantly, the beak and the mask itself contain an alchemically treated cloth that makes it much more difficult for spores and the like to penetrate the mask and enter the wearer's lungs. Completed with a set of lenses, which can be either transparent or black at the customer's request, the plague mask provides protection against many diseases and noxious fumes. Unfortunately, due to their ghoulish appearance and their connection with pestilence and death, many of the populace see wearers of such masks as little more than badly disguised scavengers. A single filter works for 24 hours. New filters are easily replaced, and costs just 2 copper pieces each. Should the lenses break, Aurora recommends that the entire mask is replaced. <strong>Aurora's Note</strong>: This mask gives advantage on saving throws against inhaled or air bases poisons and diseases. Due to the stigma attached to the mask, anyone wearing it gets disadvantage on all Charisma based checks. Using the mask for more than 24 hours, whether continuous or not, renders it inactive until the filter is replaced.</p>",

      "<p>A seedbarrow is a particular version of a wheelbarrow, one designed to lower the time needed for you to sow your seeds in the field. It's built from sturdy wood, but has two wheels at the front, set closely together. While this makes it more difficult to turn the seedbarrow, it also makes it more stable when moving it across the field. At the back is a fold-out system consisting of a small chute and pipes, that scatter seed over a 10-feet wide area behind the seedbarrow. When filled with seed or grain, the seedbarrow is then rolled along the field--depending on your crop density you can either do this at a leisurely pace or a near-run--and then seeds will gently roll down the chutes and deposit themselves in the tilled soil. This works best for grain-type crops like wheat, rye, and so on, but any seed crop can be sown in this manner.</p><p><strong>Aurora's Note</strong>: The seedbarrow generally increases crop yields by 20%, at a 5% increase in cost to seed a field.

It is the same size as a light crossbow, but it has a winch attached to the rear of it and is reinforced with steel, allowing it to be used as an anchor. It needs a series of specialized bolts, designed to punch through inanimate material, using a specially treated steel bolthead that makes it almost as strong as adamantine. Attached to the back of the bolt is a silk rope that extends 65 feet back. This is often used by acrobats and circus performers when setting up a new show, but many adventurers have found the tightrope shooter to be immensely valuable when having to cross gorges or pitfalls in dungeons. Each purchase of the tightrope shooter comes with five bolts. A new case of 5 bolts can be purchased separately at 10 gold pieces. Please note that, due to the unique properties of the bolts, they cannot be reused. The bolts come attached to the silk rope needed.</p><p><strong>Aurora's Note</strong>: When shot at a wall or other suitable feature and anchored properly (requiring a normal attack roll to hit, and a successful DC 5 Strength check), the rope extends tautly across, allowing for a user to either tightrope walk or shimmy along the rope. Provided the anchoring target can hold the weight, the rope can hold up to 300 pounds. If shot at a creature, the creature counts as being grappled until the bolt is dislodged, which requires a DC 15 Strength check or a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Dislodging it using a Strength check causes [[/r 1d4]] slashing damage. If fired using normal crossbow bolts, treat the tightrope shooter as a light crossbow.</p>",
